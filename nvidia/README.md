Great. I’ll begin a deep, PhD-level research task to create a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on how to use InstructLab ([https://instructlab.ai/](https://instructlab.ai/)) to train an LLM from scratch or through fine-tuning. This will include detailed setup instructions, environment configurations, data formatting, training processes, model evaluation, and usage—all written in a format that assumes a high level of technical proficiency.

I’ll let you know when it’s ready for your review.


# Training Large Language Models with InstructLab

InstructLab is an open-source framework by IBM/Red Hat for community-driven tuning of LLMs.  It uses a *taxonomy* of knowledge and skill recipes to generate synthetic training data and fine-tune models with minimal human-written examples.  This tutorial provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to installing InstructLab, preparing data, running training, evaluating models, and deploying or troubleshooting. It assumes a strong technical background and includes advanced topics like distributed training and community contribution workflows.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

First, provision a compatible system and install prerequisites. InstructLab runs on macOS (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3) or Linux (e.g. Fedora/Ubuntu); Windows users can use WSL2. You need a C++ compiler (e.g. GCC/Clang) for building native libraries. Install **Python 3.10 or 3.11** (supported; Python 3.12 is not yet supported). Plan for **\~60 GB free disk space** to hold models and data.

You will also need GPU libraries if using hardware acceleration. For **NVIDIA GPUs**, install CUDA drivers and toolkit; for **AMD GPUs**, install ROCm. (A CUDA-capable GPU is strongly recommended for training large models.)  Red Hat provides official container images (e.g. `redhat/instructlab:latest`) on Docker Hub and Quay that include all dependencies. You may run InstructLab inside a container engine (Docker or Podman) if preferred, but the steps below assume a native setup.

**Summary of prerequisites:**

* 64-bit macOS (M-series) or Linux (tested on Fedora/Ubuntu)
* C++ compiler (gcc/clang) for llama.cpp builds
* Python 3.10 or 3.11 (3.12 unsupported)
* NVIDIA CUDA (for GPU) or AMD ROCm (for GPU) if using hardware acceleration
* \~60 GB free disk space

Once the OS and drivers are ready, create a Python virtual environment and install InstructLab via pip. For example, on Linux or macOS:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install instructlab
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want GPU acceleration, install the CUDA extras and vLLM as follows:

```bash
pip install 'instructlab[cuda]' \
   -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_CUDA=on" \
   -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_NATIVE=off"
pip install vllm@git+https://github.com/opendatahub-io/vllm@2024.08.01
```

For AMD GPUs (ROCm), use:

```bash
pip install 'instructlab[rocm]' \
   --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.0 \
   -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on" \
   -C cmake.args="-DAMDGPU_TARGETS=all" \
   -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang" \
   -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++" \
   -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm" \
   -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_NATIVE=off"
```

(*Tip:* On macOS you may need to run `xcode-select --install` to get a compiler. If a `pip install` fails with an “unsupported instruction `vpdpbusd`” error, retry adding `-C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_NATIVE=off"` to disable optimized assembly.)

Verify the installation by running:

```bash
ilab
```

You should see the InstructLab CLI usage help. If not, re-check your Python environment and dependencies. Also consider enabling shell completion for `ilab` (bash, zsh, or fish) as described in the docs to help discover commands.

## 2. Installing and Configuring InstructLab

After installing the `ilab` CLI, initialize its configuration. Run:

```bash
ilab config init
```

This creates a default config file (usually in `~/.config/instructlab/config.yaml` on Linux). You can edit this file to set paths or customize behaviors, but the defaults typically work. The CLI is now ready to use.

Next, set up the **taxonomy** directory. InstructLab expects a filesystem tree of “knowledge” and “skills” YAML files describing tasks. By default, `ilab` will look under your local data directory (e.g. `~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/` on Linux, or `~/Library/Application Support/instructlab/taxonomy/` on macOS).

To contribute new knowledge/skills, create the appropriate directory structure and add a `qna.yaml` file. For example, to add a new knowledge item *Phoenix* under astronomy:

```bash
# Adjust path to your ILAB data directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/astronomy/constellations/Phoenix
cp my_phoenix_qna.yaml ~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/astronomy/constellations/Phoenix/qna.yaml
ilab taxonomy diff
```

The `ilab taxonomy diff` command will validate the taxonomy and list any new or changed entries. (If the taxonomy has errors, fix the YAML according to the schema.) At this point you have installed new data into the InstructLab ecosystem.

*Example:* The official docs demonstrate adding a Wikipedia-based QnA by downloading a YAML into the taxonomy and running `ilab taxonomy diff`. The same approach applies to skills and knowledge: place your YAML under `taxonomy/skills/...` or `taxonomy/knowledge/...`, then `ilab taxonomy diff`.

## 3. Preparing Training Data

InstructLab uses a structured YAML format to describe seed examples. Each `qna.yaml` file includes metadata and at least one example triple (context, question/instruction, answer). For instance, a file might look like:

```
version: 3
task_description: >-
  <description of the task>
created_by: username
seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      (background text or conversation context)
    question: >-
      (the user’s question or instruction)
    answer: >-
      (the ideal answer or solution)
```

Ensure your seed examples focus on the new content or skill you want to teach. Keep them concise (for example, under \~2300 words combined) to avoid overloading the model. You can include multiple examples in one YAML.

For domain adaptation, collect domain-specific knowledge as YAML facts and instructions. For example, if tuning a model for medical Q\&A, include relevant context and answers in the taxonomy. Use the *knowledge* category for factual information and *skills* (or *compositional skills*) for procedural or instructional tasks. Organize categories into branches (e.g. `knowledge/medicine` or `skills/diagnosis`).

After placing your YAML files, run:

```bash
ilab diff
```

to see a summary of added content. Fix any validation errors reported.

## 4. Generating and Augmenting Data

With the taxonomy ready, use InstructLab’s **synthetic data generation** (SDG) pipeline to create a large training dataset. The command is:

```bash
ilab data generate
```

This runs InstructLab’s SDG process, which uses a *teacher* LLM (by default a quantized version of “Merlinite” or a larger model if available) to expand your seed examples into many Q\&A pairs. Depending on your machine and the taxonomy size, generation can take from tens of minutes to hours (hundreds of examples per example).

By default, `ilab data generate` uses the “full” pipeline on CPU. You can enable GPU or multi-threading:

* **GPU (CUDA):**

  ```bash
  ilab data generate --pipeline full --gpus 1
  ```

  (Replace `1` with the number of GPUs.)
* **No GPU:**

  ```bash
  ilab data generate --pipeline simple
  ```

  The `simple` pipeline runs everything on CPU and may be slower.

You can also supply a different model for generation with `--model` and an endpoint (`--endpoint-url`) if desired. For example, to use a local Hugging Face model for SDG:

```bash
ilab data generate --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000/v1
```

While data is being generated, you’ll see progress logs. The generator will iterate through each leaf of your taxonomy, creating questions and answers that mix your provided knowledge with the model’s own knowledge.

When complete, InstructLab writes the synthetic dataset into the `datasets/` directory (usually `~/.local/share/instructlab/datasets`). You will see files like `knowledge_train_msgs_*.jsonl` and `skills_train_msgs_*.jsonl`. Inspect these files with `ls` or in a text editor to verify that new examples have been created. Do *not* manually edit them.

&#x20;*Figure: InstructLab uses a taxonomy of knowledge and skill nodes to generate domain-specific synthetic data. For each branch (e.g. “finance” or “email skills”), the teacher model produces 0.1–2k synthetic examples which are then used to fine-tune the base LLM via phased training【62†】.*

*(Note: The above figure illustrates the taxonomy-driven data generation process. The left branch shows generating “finance” examples, and the right shows “email” task examples. The base LLM is then fine-tuned with these combined examples.)*

## 5. Training the Model

With synthetic data ready, run the multi-phase training process. InstructLab’s default method is to first train on *knowledge* then on *skills*. The simplest command is:

```bash
ilab model train
```

(or equivalently `ilab train`). This will use the default “full” pipeline on CPU. On completion, you’ll get a new model: on Linux it is saved as a quantized GGUF file (e.g. `ggml-model-f16.gguf`) in the `models/` directory. On macOS M-series, training produces a folder (named `<model>-mlx-q`) containing LoRA adapter weights (`adapters.npz`) and config.

For GPU acceleration, use the `--device` (or alias `--gpus`) option. For example:

```bash
ilab model train --pipeline full --device cuda 
```

This will run the training on CUDA GPUs. You can also try the “accelerated” pipeline for distributed or multi-GPU setups (it uses vLLM and batching). For instance:

```bash
ilab model train --pipeline accelerated --device cuda
```

This uses multiple CUDA streams for faster throughput. The exact flags depend on your hardware. On Linux with one GPU, `--pipeline full` is sufficient. On Mac M-series, you can use `--device mps`.

The training command produces checkpoints for each epoch, but by default the best model is selected (on Linux as a `.gguf` file). You can specify the number of epochs or other hyperparameters via configuration (see `ilab config`) if needed.

**Distributed and Multi-Phase Training (advanced):** InstructLab supports a multi-phase strategy (`lab-multiphase`) to separately train knowledge and skills. For example:

```bash
ilab model train --strategy lab-multiphase \
  --phased-phase1-data datasets/knowledge_train_msgs.jsonl \
  --phased-phase2-data datasets/skills_train_msgs.jsonl
```

This command takes your two JSONL files and runs the two-phase training. Multi-GPU training can be achieved by combining `--pipeline accelerated` and multiple `--device cuda`. For more details on distributed setups, refer to the InstructLab training docs or GPU-acceleration guide.

Training can be time-consuming (hours on CPU, faster on GPU). You’ll see output logs; the final model(s) will be in `checkpoints/` and moved to `models/`. For example, after training you might find:

```
$ ls models
ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf  ggml-model-f16.gguf
```

Here `ggml-model-f16.gguf` is your new fine-tuned model.

## 6. Evaluating and Validating the Model

After training, evaluate the new model’s performance. InstructLab provides built-in benchmarks. First, locate your model file (GGUF or Safetensors). Then run:

```bash
export ILAB_MODELS_DIR=$HOME/.local/share/instructlab/models
ilab model evaluate --benchmark mmlu --model $ILAB_MODELS_DIR/instructlab/my-new-model
```

This runs the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark on your model. The CLI will print scores on various subject subsets. Other supported benchmarks include `mmlu_branch` (which measures the **improvement** over the base model), `mtbench`, and `mtbench_branch`. For example:

```bash
ilab model evaluate --benchmark mmlu_branch --model $ILAB_MODELS_DIR/instructlab/my-new-model \
  --base-model $ILAB_MODELS_DIR/instructlab/my-base-model
```

This compares your fine-tuned model to the base. By default MT-Bench uses a judge model `prometheus-8x7b-v2.0` if available.

*(Note:* The `ilab model evaluate` command requires local model files (not remote Hugging Face links) and currently supports only Safetensors or GGUF formats.)\*

You can also use `ilab model chat` to qualitatively test the model with natural-language prompts. For example:

```bash
ilab model chat -m $ILAB_MODELS_DIR/instructlab/my-new-model.gguf
```

and ask it some questions. Compare the answers to the base model to gauge improvement. It is common to see some hallucinations or irrelevant text right after fine-tuning; in practice, the model often stabilizes after some time or an OS reboot.

Additionally, there is an (experimental) `ilab model test` command (macOS only) that runs predefined tests on the model. For in-depth analysis, you can manually test on your own validation set by prompting or comparing metrics against your task-specific goals.

## 7. Deploying or Using the Trained Model

Once satisfied, you can serve or use the model locally. First, ensure the model is in GGUF format (the default on Linux). On macOS only, convert the model using:

```bash
ilab model convert
```

This quantizes and packs the fine-tuned model into a GGUF file required for serving. The output directory will contain a `.gguf` file under `*-trained`.

Then launch the model server:

```bash
ilab model serve --model-path /path/to/instructlab-*-trained/model.gguf
```

By default this starts an HTTP API on port 8000 (compatible with an OpenAI-style inference endpoint). You can then send requests to it using the `ilab chat` CLI or any API client.

Alternatively, to use the model interactively in the terminal, run:

```bash
ilab model chat -m /path/to/instructlab-*-trained/model.gguf
```

This opens a chat session with your fine-tuned model.

Finally, integrate the model into your applications as needed (e.g. via the HTTP endpoint or by loading the GGUF into tools like llama.cpp, OLLama, or LM Studio). If you packaged an OCI image earlier, you could run it in a Docker/Podman container with GPU support for production inference.

## 8. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

* **Installation errors:** If `pip install instructlab` fails with native build errors (e.g. missing CMake or unsupported instructions), ensure a working C++ compiler is available and try adding `-C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_NATIVE=off"` to disable certain CPU optimizations. On macOS, run `xcode-select --install` if needed.

* **Python version:** Using Python 3.12 or older versions may install an incompatible InstructLab release. Stick to 3.10 or 3.11.

* **GPU not recognized:** If `--device cuda` still runs on CPU, verify your CUDA and PyTorch setup. You should see a Pytorch CUDA memory table in logs when training on GPU. Reinstall PyTorch with the correct CUDA version and ensure `pip install` completed with `-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on` if on Windows/WSL (see setup docs). Check NVIDIA driver installation or ROCm environment if on Linux/AMD.

* **Out-of-memory or slow generation:** If SDG or training runs out of memory, try reducing batch sizes or using fewer threads. On Windows, InstructLab’s Clean-up step sometimes fails to delete SafeTensor files, causing file-lock errors. If that happens, stop the process, reboot or kill stuck Python processes, then retry training.

* **Output quality issues:** Immediately after training, the model’s responses may be erratic or regressive (hallucinations). This is known to occur right after fine-tuning; often waiting a bit or rebooting helps. InstructLab also advises adding more or higher-quality seed examples and re-running generation if the data seems poor. See the *Troubleshooting* section of the InstructLab docs for tips on refining prompts and teacher settings.

* **Tab-completion not working:** If shell completion for `ilab` isn’t enabled automatically, follow the CLI instructions in the docs to source the completion script in your shell RC file.

## 9. Advanced Topics

* **Distributed and Multi-GPU Training:** For very large models or data, InstructLab supports multi-GPU training. Use `--pipeline accelerated` and `--gpus N` to split work across `N` GPUs. The `lab-multiphase` strategy (shown above) itself partitions knowledge vs. skill data. For multi-node training, you could combine InstructLab with a PyTorch distributed launcher (`torchrun`) around `ilab model train`, though this is an advanced workflow.

* **Fine-tuning vs. Pre-training:** InstructLab performs **fine-tuning** (instruction-tuning) of an existing LLM. It does *not* pre-train models from scratch. Fine-tuning uses a pre-trained base (like Mistral, Granite, or Llama) and adjusts it with new synthetic data. This is far cheaper than full pre-training and is the intended use-case for InstructLab. As the Red Hat introduction notes, InstructLab “delivers big gains from small datasets” by iterating on foundation models.

* **Contributing to the Community Repository:** If your fine-tuned model performs well, consider contributing your knowledge or skills back to the InstructLab community. Package your additions in the taxonomy structure (`qna.yaml` files, etc.) and submit a GitHub pull request to the [instructlab/taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy) repository. The maintainers will review and, if accepted, incorporate it into the next community model build. InstructLab’s governance encourages a pull-request workflow: “contributors open pull requests… new skills merged into community LLM”. Check the [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

* **Community Model Builds:** Periodically, InstructLab maintainers perform a “Community Model Build” that composes all approved taxonomy contributions into a new model. These are published (e.g. on Hugging Face) as *lab-enhanced* models. You can use `ilab model download` to fetch the latest community model or view them on the InstructLab Hugging Face page.

In summary, InstructLab streamlines the LLM fine-tuning pipeline with an emphasis on *community-driven data*. This tutorial has covered the end-to-end process from setup to deployment.
